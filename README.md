Here's how you install vrecord...

## Using vrecord

###Passthrough Mode

Run passthrough mode by typing:
$ vrecord -p

Passthrough mode means that the vrecord scopes and video windows will show up, but the video signal will not be recorded to a file. This is used for things like testing your equipment or setting up a tape to bars before actually recording. When you are finished using passthrough mode simply close the vrecord window.

###Edit Mode

This mode opens a GUI window that allows you to set up all the options for recording the video signal. After selecting all of your options the video signal will be recorded to a file with some associated metadata files. When you are done recording close the vrecord window.

Run edit mode by typing:
$ vrecord -e

#### Options in edit mode

"Visual" mode
"Visual + Numerical"
Frame MD5s
