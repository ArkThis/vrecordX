## The vrecord Window

![Alt text](../vrecord_broadcast_range_visual_2016-11-22.jpg "Vrecord in Broadcast Range Visual Mode")

Shown above is the default layout of the vrecord window in "Broadcast Range Visual" mode. Vrecord also includes several other display modes discussed in [Video Capture Views](settings.md#video-capture-views).

1. **Video feed** — Displays the entire 720 x 486 video signal coming through. The image will appear a bit more stretched than it does on a television monitor. 
1. **Video feed with broadcast-safe indicator** — Displays a feed of an underscanned version of the video signal. Pixels whose luminance or chrominance is outside of broadcast range are colored yellow. Due to space constraints in the vrecord window this feed will appear slightly squeezed.  
1. **Waveform monitor** — Displays luminance values for each field of the signal separately.
1. **Vectorscope** — Displays chrominance values for the signal. The boxes represent the values for yellow, red, magenta, blue, cyan, and green. The boxes furthest from the center represent the broadcast limits for those colors.
