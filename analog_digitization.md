# Digitizing Analog Videotapes with vrecord

## Digitizing Betacam Tapes

1. Make sure you are routing the video signal from the Betacam deck into the Black Magic capture card.
2. Start by testing the signal to make sure that everything is routed properly.  
3. If bars exist on the tape, set the tape to those bars. 

### How to Set Up To Bars
First, play the tape with the bars. SMPTE color bars should look something like this in the waveform monitor:

Start by setting up the black level in the waveform monitor. The lowest black level should be at 7.5 IRE on the waveform monitor usually represented by a dotted line.
Now set the luminance level, the bar all the way on the left should hit the 75 IRE mark on the waveform monitor usually represented by a dotted line

4. Now adjust the audio levels. With two-channel stereo audio make sure the volume of both tracks is at an equal level. You may need to adjust the left or right audio level to get them even.

## Digitizing U-matic Tapes
1. Inspect the tape to make sure that it does not already have sticky shed syndrome.
